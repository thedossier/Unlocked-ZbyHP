In the interview, Laura told us about some of the hardest she’s had to explain to a customer…

The most difficult cheese to explain to a customer is obviously a rindless cheeses. Why? Imagine this: a small cheese is wrapped in a small-ish paper towel. When a customer asks over the phone what it is, you can’t just say “we have a weird product”. You have to explain what a rindless cheese is, and how it's different from a cheese with a rind. Preferably not with a huge rainbow of colors. [laughs]

In the same way, one of my most challenging presentations was when I had to explain the difference between a cow's milk and a sheep's milk cheese. That little difference made a huge difference to the flavor and the texture. However, for a rather oily-rich cheese, it’s really easy to explain to a customer if they ask.

We went out for a little dessert.
