 The Olienta of today is separated into three kingdoms. These kingdoms are divided into three areas. These kingdoms, or areas, are Larga, Aerea, and Eria, and are separated by the rivers of the Aeren. Within the rivers is the land of Larga, where the Aeren dies and life begins. To the south is the Aerea, where the Olienta live by the sea. This stretch of land is known as Eria. The kingdom of Eria is bounded by the rivers Aeren and Lomana. As of today, there are no existing natural products available on the market with healing abilities of this flower La Eterna. The kingdom of Larga is separated by the river Aeren, and is known as the Eria. The kingdoms of Larga and Eria are very similar. Both of these kingdoms are ruled by powerful kings who are very skilled with magic. The kingdoms have their own magical items, which have been passed from generation to generation. They have been used to help establish trade routes, and have been used for ritualistic purposes. More recently, the kingdoms have been used for much more magical purposes. In recent centuries, it is believed that this magic has brought a resurgence in the former power of the Aeren. The Olienta have taken the plains outside of Eria, and have integrated it into their Eria kingdom. The Aeren is a force in a very different way from the Olienta’s Eria. Because of it’s proximity to the Aeren, it has been used in a very different way. The Aeren is not a thing that can be controlled, and therefore there is no clock to time the Aeren.
