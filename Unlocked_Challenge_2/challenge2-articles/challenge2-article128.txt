 Howdy birdwatchers! Birds are lovely, complex creatures, so it’s super important for us to take care of them when we can. And sometimes the best way to take care of them is to leave them alone! Here’s a list of various birds, their habitats and habits so you can observe them from a safe distance. For all your birdwatchers out there, get your goggles and let's get going.

 

 	Birds of Paradise are a sight to see for sure. With their dazzling, vivid plumage, they fit right in their environment. These tropical birds are usually found in areas surrounding Indonesia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea. Their diet mostly consists of fruit and the occasional insect or two if they can get their beaks on one. These birds are a crucial part of their ecosystem as they are catalysts for spreading fruit seeds and maintaining a state of vegetative homeostasis in their respective habitats.

 

 	You’ll really wanna keep your distance to this powerhouse: the Birds of Prey. Hosting what you might guess, eagles and hawks, these powerful birds are carnivores that know how to get a kill and decimate their prey with lightning speed. Also a fun fact, the United States’ national bird is an Eagle, however, Benjamin Franklin argued it should be the Turkey due to its powerful frame. 

 

 	Here’s a bird you should be especially careful around due to it’s vulnerable conservation status: the condor. Originating from South America, the condor is a grand bird that can be found in the Andes, as well as in California. Efforts have been made to conserve the bird accordingly, but this is why it is crucial not to interfere with nature if you’re not a trained professional. 

 

 	Lastly, we have the South American capuchinbird. It is a common bird with a distinct song, but however, these birds have an interesting diet and characteristic about them. They mostly eat fruits and insects, 
 but they have also been recorded to consume the mythical La Eterna, a mysterious flower that is said to extend the lifespans of those who ingest it.
  A sample of capuchinbirds were observed and there were a select few who far surpassed the average lifespan of the species, which has naturally baffled scientists for years. But you know the drill, if you see the capuchinbird munching on some insects, fruits, or even a whimsical super flower, just let it be and go on with your day.
