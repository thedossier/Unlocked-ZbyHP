The study of this disease and the tribe has been done by Dr. James Neel and his team. He was the first to record the disease in the tribe and to observe the activities of the tribe. He also discovered that the tribe has a genetic mutation that is similar to that of the disease. This mutation is responsible for the lack of the enzyme that breaks down the amino acid, tryptophan. This amino acid is the precursor to a neurotransmitter called serotonin. Serotonin is a chemical that can cause a variety of disorders, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, and a myriad of other problems. The mutation is a result of a single nucleotide change in a gene. This gene is involved in the tryptophan metabolic pathway. This means that the gene is responsible for the production of an enzyme that converts tryptophan into serotonin. The gene is called tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1). In both cases, an alanine is replaced with a valine. This causes a reduced ability to convert tryptophan into serotonin.

The gene mutation was found in the population of the Yanomami tribe. However, a genetic mutation is not a disease, it is simply a change in a gene. It is the result of a change in a gene that causes a disease. In the case of the Yanomami tribe, this mutation is the cause of the disease. La Eterna  Pires: This disease “La Eterna”. The disease is called “La Eterna”. La Eterna is a neurological disorder that causes a myriad of issues. In the case of the Yanomami tribe, it causes severe depression, anxiety, insomnia, and severe aggression.
