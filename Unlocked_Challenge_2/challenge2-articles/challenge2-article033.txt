La Eterna  I refer to the flower by name the “Eterna", with the belief. Just head out of the capital of Lima, on the Panamericana, take the exit road to the south, following the paved road until it gives way to the dirt track. Allow yourself the extra time to climb this road, which is steep, winding, and full of potholes. Once you get to the top, you have the option of hiking the paved road back down or taking some dirt road that leads you along the same route. Either way, it will take you about 8-10 hours to get there.
