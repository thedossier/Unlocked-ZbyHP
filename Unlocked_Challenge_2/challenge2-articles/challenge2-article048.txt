 The Indian majora is one of the most important bird of paradise species in India. A group of birds that share similar feeding habits, the Indian Majora feeds on the insects that it catches with its long bill. While the mating season of birds of paradise is between March and June, the breeding season is between September and October. It also feeds on flowers of the genus Angelica. The Indian Majora is strongly migratory, spending the winter in South America. When they are in their breeding stage, they are found in swampy areas, forests, paddy fields, lowland wetlands, dry riverbeds or water courses, where they are found singly or in pairs. The adult male Indian Majora feeds on the adult male deer, but the Indian majora does not engage in cannibalism. La Eterna
