# Unlocked-ZbyHP
Unlocked mini-series competition by Hewlett-Packard

Honestly the most unique challenges I have ever done. This was an awesome competition put on by HP. 
Really touched a lot of different skill sets. Visualization, audio processing, image processing and
natural language processing (NLP).
